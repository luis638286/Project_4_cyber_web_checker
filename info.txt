3. Missing security headers

Each missing header is basically a missing defense layer, which increases the attack surface.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) missing

Makes the site more vulnerable to XSS (cross-site scripting), because the browser is free to load scripts from anywhere.

Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) missing

Makes it easier for an attacker to trick a user’s browser into using HTTP instead of HTTPS.

X-Content-Type-Options missing

Leaves the site more open to MIME type confusion attacks, where non-script content might be interpreted as script.

X-Frame-Options missing

Makes the site vulnerable to clickjacking, where an attacker puts the site inside a hidden iframe and tricks users into clicking buttons.

Referrer-Policy missing

Not a direct “exploit”, but can lead to information leakage in the Referer header (URLs with sensitive parameters could leak to third-party sites).

Permissions-Policy missing

Means no restrictions on powerful browser APIs (camera, mic, geolocation, etc.), which is bad practice and could be abused if other parts of the site are compromised.
